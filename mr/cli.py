"""`mr` command-line interface (typer app).

Exposes the full captured pipeline from the terminal:

- ``process``: transcribe an existing ``--mic``/``--system`` WAV pair and
  write the attributed Markdown transcript (plus optional JSON sidecar).
- ``start``: spawn ``mr-capture`` (long-lived; outlives this command) and
  record the pidfile state.
- ``status``: is a capture active? plus the most recent transcript.
- ``stop``: SIGINT the capture, wait briefly for its WAVs, clear state,
  and spawn ``mr _transcribe`` as a detached background process
  (transcription + notification happen after ``mr stop`` returns).
- ``toggle``: start if idle/stale, else stop.
- ``doctor``: environment check (macOS version, helper binary, model cache);
  ``--fetch-model`` pre-downloads the Whisper model.

The long-lived spawn in ``start`` deliberately does NOT use
``RecordSession`` (its ``__exit__`` reaps/signals the child); instead the
binary is spawned via ``subprocess.Popen`` and only the PID is persisted.

    seam; the Swift/menu-bar caller never passes it.

    The WAVs are the precondition: a recording is transcribable only while

    ``stop`` deletes the WAVs after a successful transcription, so a later
    re-transcribe simply has no audio left to re-read — refuse rather than
    spawn a worker that is guaranteed to fail.

    A fresh heartbeat for the same stamp means a live worker owns this
    recording: never start a second one over a running one.

    The worker is spawned detached (exactly like ``mr stop``), so the caller
    returns immediately while transcription continues in the background.

    The existing ``transcripts/<stamp>.md`` is deliberately NOT deleted or
    truncated: the worker overwrites it on success, and a user's transcript
    must never disappear because a re-run was attempted.
